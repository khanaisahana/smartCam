## AI based picture translation app

AI based picture translation app uses this AI-powered photo translation system to identify the object and text to translate them into the userâ€™s desired language.
The system uses Object Detection from Tensorflow to recognize the object and it is a part of Machine Learning (ML). 
Similarly, for Text, we are using Text Detection from Tensorflow to recognize the Text, and it is also part of ML. 
It translates the text or object into a preferred language. 

The system comprises 2 major modules with their sub-modules as follows:
### 1.    Object Detect
Capture or choose any photo of an Object
By default, Source Language is English
Choose Language to Translate the Result
Speak option available


### 2.    Text Detect
Capture or choose any photo to Translate text in that Photo
By default, Source Language is English
Choose Language to Translate the Result
Speak option is available

Object detection and text detection are two important applications of machine learning that can be accomplished using the TensorFlow library. 
Object detection involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or video stream. This technique has numerous applications, such as in self-driving cars, surveillance systems, and medical imaging.
Text detection, on the other hand, involves identifying and localizing text within an image or video stream. This technique has applications in fields such as document analysis, optical character recognition (OCR), and automatic license plate recognition (ALPR).
